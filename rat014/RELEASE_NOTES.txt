              Apache Creadur Rat 0.14
                  RELEASE NOTES

The Apache Creadur Rat team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Creadur Rat 0.14

Apache Rat is a release audit tool. It improves accuracy and efficiency when checking
releases. It is heuristic in nature: making guesses about possible problems. It
will produce false positives and cannot find every possible issue with a release.
Its reports require interpretation.

In response to demands from project quality tool developers, Rat is available as a
library suitable for inclusion in tools. This POM describes that library.
Note that binary compatibility is not guaranteed between 0.x releases.

Apache Rat is developed by the Apache Creadur project, a language and build
agnostic home for software distribution comprehension and audit tools.

This release contains dependency updates, bugfixes and many improvements apart from infrastructure updates at ASF.

o RAT-288:  Adapt logging output to be more compliant with future Maven versions as debug is deprecated and verbose is the recommended way to go. Thanks to Michael Osipov.
