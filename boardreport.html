    Branding and Trademarks
    -----------------------
    The site has now been checked and updated against the 
    branding policy. In particular:
      * Project Website Basics
      * Website Navigation Links
      * Trademark Attributions
      * Logos and Graphics
      * Project Metadata
      * Read PMC Branding Responsibilities 

    Community
    ---------
    Interest seems to be slowly building, which is encouraging.
    We hope to focus on continuing to improve the documentation
    and creating a first release for Apache Whisker.

    Infrastructure

    We are still trying to discover the best way to maintain 
    a mix of subsites generated by and hand maintained content
    in Apache CMS. Thanks to Infrastructure for their help
    and advice.

    Status report for the Apache Creadur project - JUNE 2012

    Apache Creadur creates and maintains a suite of open source 
    software related to the auditing and comprehension of 
    software distributions. Any language and build system are 
    welcomed.

    Project Status
    --------------

    Creadur graduated from the Apache Incubator in April, 2012.
    The handover has been very slow going, but is very nearly
    complete. Thanks to the infrastructure team for their help.

    Handover
    --------
    Complete: 
     * New Chair tasks (subscriptions, update officers, etc)
     * Reporting schedule
     * PMC bootstrap tasks
     * Transfer source
     * Transfer mailing lists
     * Update issue tracker
     * Infra tasks
     * Transfer website
     * Update incubator records
    Pending Next Release (as per guidelines)
     * Distribution mirrors

    Community
    ---------
    * Creadur needs to rebuild momentum and to attract new 
      contributors. Our first steps will be website 
      improvements and the first release of Apache Whisker 
      (see below). 

    Infrastructure
    --------------
    * Thanks to the infra team for a smooth handover
    * Our website uses the CMS, and is ready for svnsubpub. The 
      community is still discussing the best approach towards 
      maintaining content generated by Maven.  

    Releases
    --------
    None (yet). The last release happened while the project was 
    incubating: RAT 0.8 released in November 2011.

    We hope to cut the first release of Apache Whisker very 
    soon. This tool generates and audits licensing information
    from meta-data. Helpful for applications assembled from 100s 
    of components, such as Apache James Server.

    Branding and Trademarks
    -----------------------
    Currently our website doesn't conform to all requirements. 
    In particular the product subsites need more work. 

    Community Objectives
    --------------------
    * Improve impact and visibility of site, and bring the site fully 
      into line with the branding guidelines
    * Release Apache Whisker 0.1
