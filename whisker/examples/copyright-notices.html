<h2><a name="All_About_Copyright_Notices"></a>All About Copyright Notices</h2>
<p><a class="externalLink" href="http://creadur.apache.org/whisker"> Apache Whisker</a> is based around <a href="../meta-data.html">meta-data</a> describing the licensing qualities of documents included within <a href="../faq.html#complex-software-applications">complex software distributions</a>. Whisker just helps to maintain information more efficiently, and is <a href="../faq.html#what-whisker-is-not">no substitute</a> for solid legal work. Learn about copyright and software licensing <a href="../faq.html#more-resources">here</a>.</p>
<p>This example has been carefully chosen to illuminate the tricky topic of <a href="../faq.html#what-copyright-notice">copyright notices</a>. Whisker means by this the copyright claims included at the start of some licenses (for example, the <a class="externalLink" href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT Licence</a>), corresponding to <code>copyright-notice</code> <a href="../meta-data.html#Variable_Copyright_Notices">meta data</a>. Copyright claims which are included in <a href="../faq.html#notice-vs-copyright-notice"><code>NOTICE</code></a>s should be included within the <code>notice</code> meta data, and not added as <code>copyright-notice</code> elements. If the copyright claim belongs in the <code>LICENSE</code> document then use a <code>copyright-notice</code>. If the copyright claim belongs in the <code>NOTICE</code> document then include it within a <code>notice</code>.</p>
<p>If this isn't quite what you're looking for, take a look at:</p>
<ul>

<h3><a name="Licenses.2C_Claims_and_Copyright_Notices"></a>Licenses, Claims and Copyright Notices</h3><section>
<h4><a name="What_Whisker_Means_By_a_Copyright_Notice"></a>What Whisker Means By a Copyright Notice</h4>
<p>A copyright notice is a simple claim of ownership, typically by an author of the work. For example</p>
<div class="source">
<pre>        Copyright (c) YEAR A.N.AUTHOR</pre></div>
<p><b>Do not</b> confuse a <i>copyright notice</i> with the <code>NOTICE</code> that some licenses require to be distributed. A typical <code>NOTICE</code> contains attribution information (for example <i>This products contains software developed by the Apache Software Foundation</i>) as well as a copyright notice.</p>
<p>Many license definitions (for example, The <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php"> MIT License</a>) conventionally include a copyright notice. The contents of these copyright notices vary widely.</p>
<p>Whisker separates <code>copyright-notice</code> from <code>license</code> to reduce duplication. (Optionally) a <code>copyright-notice</code> begins a <code>with-license</code> block, before <code>resource</code> grouped <code>by-organisation</code> sharing this <code>copyright-notice</code> and <code>license</code>.</p></section><section>
<h4><a name="When_a_Copyright_Notice_is_Needed"></a>When a Copyright Notice is Needed</h4>
<p>Only a few licenses use <code>copyright-notice</code> elements to contain claims. When a <code>copyright-notice</code> is used, the claim will be printed immediately before the associated license in the <code>LICENSE</code> document. This will only be correct if the original license includes this copyright at this location.</p>
<p>When copyright claims are included in <code>NOTICE</code> documents, then include these claims instead in appropriate <code>notice</code> meta-data.</p>
<p>When copyright claims are included within the body of a license text, then create a <a href="./license-family.html">template</a> and pass the claim as a parameter.</p></section><section>
<h4><a name="Primary_Copyright_Notice"></a>Primary Copyright Notice</h4>
<p>When the <a href="../faq.html#what-is-primary">primary license</a> uses copyright notices, you should add a <a href="../faq.html#what-is-primary">primary copyright notice</a>. For an example, see <a href="./in-5-mins">Whisker In 5 Minutes</a>.</p></section></section><section>
<h3><a name="And_Now_-_On_With_the_Example"></a>And Now - On With the Example</h3>
<p>To illustrate how and when to use copyright notices, we'll create meta data for a project that uses a license (<a class="externalLink" href="http://opensource.org/licenses/CDDL-1.0">CDDL 1.0</a>) which requires neither <code>notice</code> nor <code>copyright-notice</code>. We'll create meta-data for a project which distributes a release containing one work which requires a <code>copyright-notice</code> (MIT License) and another one which requires a <code>notice</code> (<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache License, Version 2</a>), as well as works under the primary (CDDL1.0) license.</p><section>
<h4><a name="Definitions"></a>Definitions</h4><section>

            (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
                trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer, to use, reproduce,
                modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the
                Original Software (or portions thereof), with or without
                Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

            (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using or selling
                of Original Software, to make, have made, use, practice, sell,
                and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original
                Software (or portions thereof).

            (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b) are effective
                on the date Initial Developer first distributes or otherwise
                makes the Original Software available to a third party under
                the terms of this License.

            (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
                granted: (1) for code that You delete from the Original
                Software, or (2) for infringements caused by: (i) the
                modification of the Original Software, or (ii) the
                combination of the Original Software with other software
                or devices.

        2.2. Contributor Grant.

        Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject to
        third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants
        You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:

            (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
                trademark) Licensable by Contributor to use, reproduce, modify,
                display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
                created by such Contributor (or portions thereof), either on
                an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered
                Software and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

            (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or
                selling of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone
                and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions
                of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
                made, and/or otherwise dispose of: (1) Modifications made by
                that Contributor (or portions thereof); and (2) the combination
                of Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
                Version (or portions of such combination).

            (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are
                effective on the date Contributor first distributes or otherwise
                makes the Modifications available to a third party.

            (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
                granted: (1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from
                the Contributor Version; (2) for infringements caused by: (i)
                third party modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii) the
                combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with
                other software (except as part of the Contributor Version)
                or other devices; or (3) under Patent Claims infringed by
                Covered Software in the absence of Modifications made by that
                Contributor.

    3. Distribution Obligations.

        3.1. Availability of Source Code.

        Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available
        in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form
        and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms
        of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every
        copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute
        or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such
        Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such
        Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
        through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

        3.2. Modifications.

        The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
        governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe
        Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have
        sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

        3.3. Required Notices.

        You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
        identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not
        remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained
        within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any
        descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the
        Initial Developer.

        3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

        You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software
        in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version
        of this License or the recipients rights hereunder. You may choose
        to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
        or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
        Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not
        on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must
        make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
        You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
        Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer
        or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity
        or liability terms You offer.

        3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

        You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software
        under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license
        of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
        provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
        and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
        limit or alter the recipients rights in the Source Code form from
        the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
        Software in Executable form under a different license, You must
        make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this
         License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer
         or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
         Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
         by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
         any such terms You offer.

        3.6. Larger Works.

        You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software
        with other code not governed by the terms of this License and
        distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case,
        You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled
        for the Covered Software.

    4. Versions of the License.

        4.1. New Versions.

        Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish
        revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time.
        Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
        Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license
        steward has the right to modify this License.

        4.2. Effect of New Versions.

        You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
        Software available under the terms of the version of the License under
        which You originally received the Covered Software. If the
        Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
        prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available
        under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute
        and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
        version of the License under which You originally received the
        Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use,
        distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available
        under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
        published by the license steward.

        4.3. Modified Versions.

        When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license
        for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version
        of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any
        references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the
        license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it
        clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.

    5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

    COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
    WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF
    DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
    THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED
    SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE
    IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
    CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
    CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL
    PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED
    HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

    6. TERMINATION.

        6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
         automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail
         to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the
         breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
         beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

        6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
        declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
        Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
        You assert such claim is referred to as Participant) alleging
        that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version
        where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software
        where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or
        indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights
        granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant,
        the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the
        Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or
        2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant
        terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration
        of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day
        period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
        Software against such Participant either unilaterally or
        pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.

        6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
        all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or
        any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding
        licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive
        termination.

    7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
    INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
    COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
    LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
    OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
    LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
    STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
    COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
    INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
    LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
    INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
    APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
    NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
    APPLY TO YOU.

    8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

    The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined
    in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer
    software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.  252.227-7014(a)(1))
    and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are
    used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R.
    12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
    all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only
    those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause
    is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause
    or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software
    under this License.

    9. MISCELLANEOUS.

    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
    extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
    governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
    contained within the Original Software (except to the extent
    applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
    jurisdictions conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating
    to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the
    courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a
    notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing
    party responsible for costs, including, without limitation,
    court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The
    application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
    the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law
    or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
    shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
    License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance
    with the United States export administration regulations (and the
    export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when
    You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered
    Software.

    10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
    out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
    work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
    responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended
    or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
        &lt;/text&gt;

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

      &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<p>Add <a href="../faq.html#why-ids">references</a> to the main license (CDDL 1.0) and organisation (<i>The Example Project</i>).</p>
<p>The CDDL 1.0 has no <a href="../faq.html#when-notice-needed">retention clause</a> (and so no <code>primary-notice</code> needs to be added), and includes no copyright claim (and so no <code>&lt;copyright-notice</code> is needed either).</p>

    &lt;primary-license id='osi:CDDL-1.0'/&gt;

<p>Let's assume (for clarity) that the distribution contains only three works:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cddl.txt</code></li>
<li><code>mit.txt</code></li>
<li><code>apache.txt</code></li></ul>
<p>all in the root directory and all licensed from <i>The Example Org</i> with the licenses that their names suggest.</p>
<p>As noted above, the primary license (CDDL 1.0) needs neither <code>notice</code> nor <code>copyright-notice</code>.</p>
<div class="source">
<pre>    ...
    &lt;within dir='.'&gt;
        &lt;with-license id='osi:CDDL-1.0'&gt;

                &lt;resource name='cddl.txt'/&gt;
            &lt;/by-organisation&gt;
        &lt;/with-license&gt;
        ...</pre></div>
<p>The MIT License usually requires a <code>copyright-notice</code>. Consulting the license text, we find the copyright claim is <i>Copyright (c) 2525 The Example Project</i>. This should be entered as a <code>copyright-notice</code> child of the <code>with-license</code>, so that this appears before the plain MIT text in the generated <code>LICENSE</code>.</p>
<div class="source">
<pre>    ...
        &lt;with-license id='osi:mit'&gt;
            &lt;copyright-notice&gt;Copyright (c) 2525 The Example Project&lt;/copyright-notice&gt;
            &lt;by-organisation id='example.org'&gt;

            &lt;/by-organisation&gt;
        &lt;/with-license&gt;
        ...</pre></div>
<p>In contrast, the Apache License, Version 2 has a retention clause and typically has a <code>NOTICE</code> which must be redistributed. Consulting the release containing <code>apache.txt</code>, we find that the appropriate <code>NOTICE</code> is as follows:</p>
<div class="source">
<pre>Copyright (c) 2525 The Example Project http://example.org</pre></div>
<p>So, within <code>notices</code> we add a <code>notice</code> then reference the <code>notice</code> by id in the <code>resource</code>.</p>
<div class="source">
<pre>    &lt;notices&gt;
      &lt;notice id='example.org'&gt;
      Copyright (c) 2525 The Example Project http://example.org

        3. Distribution Obligations.

        3.1. Availability of Source Code.

        Any
        Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available
        in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code
        form
        and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the
        terms
        of this License. You must include a copy of this License
        with every
        copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software
        You distribute
        or otherwise make available. You must inform
        recipients of any such
        Covered Software in Executable form as to
        how they can obtain such
        Covered Software in Source Code form in
        a reasonable manner on or
        through a medium customarily used for
        software exchange.

        3.2. Modifications.

        The Modifications that You
        create or to which You contribute are
        governed by the terms of
        this License. You represent that You believe
        Your Modifications
        are Your original creation(s) and/or You have
        sufficient rights
        to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

        3.3. Required
        Notices.

        You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications
        that
        identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You
        may not
        remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark
        notices contained
        within the Covered Software, or any notices of
        licensing or any
        descriptive text giving attribution to any
        Contributor or the
        Initial Developer.

        3.4. Application of
        Additional Terms.

        You may not offer or impose any terms on any
        Covered Software
        in Source Code form that alters or restricts the
        applicable version
        of this License or the recipients rights
        hereunder. You may choose
        to offer, and to charge a fee for,
        warranty, support, indemnity
        or liability obligations to one or
        more recipients of Covered
        Software. However, you may do so only
        on Your own behalf, and not
        on behalf of the Initial Developer or
        any Contributor. You must
        make it absolutely clear that any such
        warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligation is offered
        by You alone, and
        You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
        Developer and every
        Contributor for any liability incurred by the
        Initial Developer
        or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
        support, indemnity
        or liability terms You offer.

        3.5. Distribution
        of Executable Versions.

        You may distribute the Executable form of
        the Covered Software
        under the terms of this License or under the
        terms of a license
        of Your choice, which may contain terms
        different from this License,
        provided that You are in compliance
        with the terms of this License
        and that the license for the
        Executable form does not attempt to
        limit or alter the recipients
        rights in the Source Code form from
        the rights set forth in this
        License. If You distribute the Covered
        Software in Executable
        form under a different license, You must
        make it absolutely clear
        that any terms which differ from this
        License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer
        or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
        Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
        by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
        any such terms You offer.

        3.6. Larger Works.

        You may create a Larger Work
        by combining Covered Software
        with other code not governed by the
        terms of this License and
        distribute the Larger Work as a single
        product. In such a case,
        You must make sure the requirements of
        this License are fulfilled
        for the Covered Software.

        4. Versions of the License.

        4.1. New Versions.

        Sun Microsystems, Inc. is
        the initial license steward and may publish
        revised and/or new
        versions of this License from time to time.
        Each version will be
        given a distinguishing version number.
        Except as provided in
        Section 4.3, no one other than the license
        steward has the right
        to modify this License.

        4.2. Effect of New Versions.

        You may
        always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
        Software available under the terms of the version of the License
        under
        which You originally received the Covered Software. If the
        Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
        prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made
        available
        under any subsequent version of the License, You must
        distribute
        and make the Covered Software available under the
        terms of the
        version of the License under which You originally
        received the
        Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to
        use,
        distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available
        under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
        published by the license steward.

        4.3. Modified Versions.

        When You
        are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license
        for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified
        version
        of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove
        any
        references to the name of the license steward (except to note
        that the
        license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise
        make it
        clear that the license contains terms which differ from
        this License.

        5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

        COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
        WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE
        OF
        DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
        THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED
        SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
        DEFECTIVE
        IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
        CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
        OR
        CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL
        PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED
        HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

        6. TERMINATION.

        6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
        terminate
        automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail
        to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the
        breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
        beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

        6.2. If You assert a
        patent infringement claim (excluding
        declaratory judgment
        actions) against Initial Developer or a
        Contributor (the Initial
        Developer or Contributor against whom
        You assert such claim is
        referred to as Participant) alleging
        that the Participant
        Software (meaning the Contributor Version
        where the Participant
        is a Contributor or the Original Software
        where the Participant
        is the Initial Developer) directly or
        indirectly infringes any
        patent, then any and all rights
        granted directly or indirectly to
        You by such Participant,
        the Initial Developer (if the Initial
        Developer is not the
        Participant) and all Contributors under
        Sections 2.1 and/or
        2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
        notice from Participant
        terminate prospectively and automatically
        at the expiration
        of such 60 day notice period, unless if within
        such 60 day
        period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
        Participant
        Software against such Participant either unilaterally
        or
        pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.

        6.3. In the
        event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
        all end
        user licenses that have been validly granted by You or
        any
        distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding
        licenses
        granted to You by any distributor) shall survive
        termination.

        7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

        UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
        (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
        INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
        COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
        LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
        OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
        LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
        STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
        COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
        INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
        LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
        INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
        APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
        NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
        APPLY TO YOU.

        8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

        The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined
        in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer
        software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.
        252.227-7014(a)(1))
        and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are
        used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R.
        12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
        all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only
        those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause
        is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause
        or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software
        under this License.

        9. MISCELLANEOUS.

        This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
        matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
        unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
        extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
        governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
        contained within the Original Software (except to the extent
        applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
        jurisdictions conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation
        relating
        to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the
        courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a
        notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing
        party responsible for costs, including, without limitation,
        court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The
        application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
        the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law
        or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
        shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
        License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance
        with the United States export administration regulations (and the
        export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when
        You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered
        Software.

        10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

        As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
        responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
        indirectly,
        out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
        work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
        responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended
        or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

        &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
        form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
        editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other
        modifications
        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the
        interfaces of,
        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

        &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
        the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
        to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
        submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright
        owner
        or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,
        &quot;submitted&quot;
        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
        to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control
        systems,
        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work,
        but
        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
        designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

        &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal
        Entity
        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
        subsequently incorporated within the Work.

        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute
        the
        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
        made,
        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If
        You
        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
        as of the date such litigation is filed.

        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
        meet the following conditions:

        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that You changed the files; and

        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
        the Derivative Works; and

        (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
        as modifying the License.

        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
        with
        the conditions stated in this License.

        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the
        Work
        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or
        modify
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the
        Licensor,
        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE
        file.

        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
        the
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
        grossly
        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as
        a
        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
        indemnity,
        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act
        only
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

        makes the Original Software available to a third party under
        the terms of this License.

        (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
        granted: (1) for code that You delete from the Original
        Software, or (2) for infringements caused by: (i) the
        modification of the Original Software, or (ii) the
        combination of the Original Software with other software
        or devices.

        2.2. Contributor Grant.

        Conditioned upon Your compliance
        with Section 3.1 below and subject to
        third party intellectual
        property claims, each Contributor hereby grants
        You a world-wide,
        royalty-free, non-exclusive license:

        display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
        created by such Contributor (or portions thereof), either on
        an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered
        Software and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

        Contributor.

        3. Distribution Obligations.

        3.1. Availability of Source Code.

        Any
        Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available
        in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code
        form
        and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the
        terms
        of this License. You must include a copy of this License
        with every
        copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software
        You distribute
        or otherwise make available. You must inform
        recipients of any such
        Covered Software in Executable form as to
        how they can obtain such
        Covered Software in Source Code form in
        a reasonable manner on or
        through a medium customarily used for
        software exchange.

        3.2. Modifications.

        The Modifications that You
        create or to which You contribute are
        governed by the terms of
        this License. You represent that You believe
        Your Modifications
        are Your original creation(s) and/or You have
        sufficient rights
        to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

        3.3. Required
        Notices.

        You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications
        that
        identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You
        may not
        remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark
        notices contained
        within the Covered Software, or any notices of
        licensing or any
        descriptive text giving attribution to any
        Contributor or the
        Initial Developer.

        3.4. Application of
        Additional Terms.

        You may not offer or impose any terms on any
        Covered Software
        in Source Code form that alters or restricts the
        applicable version
        of this License or the recipients rights
        hereunder. You may choose
        to offer, and to charge a fee for,
        warranty, support, indemnity
        or liability obligations to one or
        more recipients of Covered
        Software. However, you may do so only
        on Your own behalf, and not
        on behalf of the Initial Developer or
        any Contributor. You must
        make it absolutely clear that any such
        warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligation is offered
        by You alone, and
        You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
        Developer and every
        Contributor for any liability incurred by the
        Initial Developer
        or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
        support, indemnity
        or liability terms You offer.

        3.5. Distribution
        of Executable Versions.

        You may distribute the Executable form of
        the Covered Software
        under the terms of this License or under the
        terms of a license
        of Your choice, which may contain terms
        different from this License,
        provided that You are in compliance
        with the terms of this License
        and that the license for the
        Executable form does not attempt to
        limit or alter the recipients
        rights in the Source Code form from
        the rights set forth in this
        License. If You distribute the Covered
        Software in Executable
        form under a different license, You must
        make it absolutely clear
        that any terms which differ from this
        License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer
        or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
        Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
        by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
        any such terms You offer.

        3.6. Larger Works.

        You may create a Larger Work
        by combining Covered Software
        with other code not governed by the
        terms of this License and
        distribute the Larger Work as a single
        product. In such a case,
        You must make sure the requirements of
        this License are fulfilled
        for the Covered Software.

        4. Versions of the License.

        4.1. New Versions.

        Sun Microsystems, Inc. is
        the initial license steward and may publish
        revised and/or new
        versions of this License from time to time.
        Each version will be
        given a distinguishing version number.
        Except as provided in
        Section 4.3, no one other than the license
        steward has the right
        to modify this License.

        4.2. Effect of New Versions.

        You may
        always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
        Software available under the terms of the version of the License
        under
        which You originally received the Covered Software. If the
        Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
        prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made
        available
        under any subsequent version of the License, You must
        distribute
        and make the Covered Software available under the
        terms of the
        version of the License under which You originally
        received the
        Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to
        use,
        distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available
        under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
        published by the license steward.

        4.3. Modified Versions.

        When You
        are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license
        for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified
        version
        of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove
        any
        references to the name of the license steward (except to note
        that the
        license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise
        make it
        clear that the license contains terms which differ from
        this License.

        5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

        COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
        WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE
        OF
        DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
        THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED
        SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
        DEFECTIVE
        IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
        CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
        OR
        CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL
        PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED
        HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

        6. TERMINATION.

        6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
        terminate
        automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail
        to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the
        breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
        beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

        6.2. If You assert a
        patent infringement claim (excluding
        declaratory judgment
        actions) against Initial Developer or a
        Contributor (the Initial
        Developer or Contributor against whom
        You assert such claim is
        referred to as Participant) alleging
        that the Participant
        Software (meaning the Contributor Version
        where the Participant
        is a Contributor or the Original Software
        where the Participant
        is the Initial Developer) directly or
        indirectly infringes any
        patent, then any and all rights
        granted directly or indirectly to
        You by such Participant,
        the Initial Developer (if the Initial
        Developer is not the
        Participant) and all Contributors under
        Sections 2.1 and/or
        2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
        notice from Participant
        terminate prospectively and automatically
        at the expiration
        of such 60 day notice period, unless if within
        such 60 day
        period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
        Participant
        Software against such Participant either unilaterally
        or
        pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.

        6.3. In the
        event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
        all end
        user licenses that have been validly granted by You or
        any
        distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding
        licenses
        granted to You by any distributor) shall survive
        termination.

        7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

        UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
        (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
        INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
        COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
        LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
        OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
        LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
        STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
        COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
        INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
        LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
        INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
        APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
        NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
        APPLY TO YOU.

        8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

        The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined
        in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer
        software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.
        252.227-7014(a)(1))
        and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are
        used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R.
        12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
        all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only
        those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause
        is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause
        or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software
        under this License.

        9. MISCELLANEOUS.

        This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
        matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
        unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
        extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
        governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
        contained within the Original Software (except to the extent
        applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
        jurisdictions conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation
        relating
        to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the
        courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a
        notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing
        party responsible for costs, including, without limitation,
        court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The
        application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
        the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law
        or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
        shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
        License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance
        with the United States export administration regulations (and the
        export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when
        You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered
        Software.

        10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

        As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
        responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
        indirectly,
        out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
        work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
        responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended
        or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

                    &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
                    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

                    modifications
                    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
                    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the
                    interfaces of,
                    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

                    &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including

                    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                    designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

                    subsequently incorporated within the Work.

                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute
                    the
                    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
                    made,
                    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If
                    You
                    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                    as of the date such litigation is filed.

                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                    meet the following conditions:

                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that You changed the files; and

                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                    the Derivative Works; and

                    (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
                    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                    as modifying the License.

                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
                    with
                    the conditions stated in this License.

                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the
                    Work
                    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or
                    modify
                    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the
                    Licensor,
                    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE
                    file.

                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
                    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
                    the
                    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
                    grossly
                    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as
                    a
                    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
                    indemnity,
                    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act
                    only
                    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
